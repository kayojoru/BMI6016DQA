Using the concept definitions and measures in any of the module papers (or another framework of your choosing), provide a data quality assessment report for this dataset (TNX_20200129 Download TNX_20200129 Download TNX_20200129). This is stored as an Excel file.

Use graphs, descriptive summaries (like a count or %) or simple statistics as appropriate. Report on at least two data domains (Each tab in the spreadsheet, excluding the Data Set Details tab, is a domain). The report should specify what framework(s) you used to guide the assessment. You will not be assessing all aspects of the dataset but providing example data quality assessments. Keep your response to 4 or 5 pages. Submit your response as a word or PDF file.
